Script Fighter is a terminal-based Python game that brings the thrill of classic arcade fighting to your command line! Featuring nostalgic ASCII art inspired by Street Fighter, this game offers a unique twist on the traditional rock-paper-scissors mechanic with a four-way input system.
You can choose to play against AI and choose from 3 opponents, each with different fighting styles.
Or you can play local 2 player with a buddy.
You can name your character with special win screens for perfect KOs and close matches.
There is even a secret boss fight, if you have the skill.

I tried my best to make every option feel worthwhile, but let me know if you find any abuseable strategies!
